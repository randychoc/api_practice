# API_Practice_Step_By_Step

## Build With
- Express
- MongoDB

**STEPS:**
---
1) nodejs and express
    - `npm i express -S`
2) nodemon, Controllers and Routes
    - `npm i nodemon -D`
    - folders: controllers and routes
3) mongodb, mongoose y Models
    - `npm i mongoose -S`
    > It's necessary to have MongoDB installed on your computer (mongod)
    - folder: models
4) get, body-parser or express, post, Postman
    - `npm i body-parser -S`
    - Since Express 4.16.0 we can use `express.urlencoded({extended: true})` and `express.json()` instead of `bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true})` and `bodyParser.json()`
    - Noted: Is not necessary to install Body-Parser. 
    - Use of the Postman Tool for requests.
